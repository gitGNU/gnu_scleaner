To build, enter the build folder, then type cmake /path_to_source/
Then type make.
Now the binary is ready, you can launch it : ./scleaner
Don't forget to create folder : plugs
For the moment you have to link plugins in <b>plugs</b> : cd plugs; ln -s ../lib*.so (Fix soon)


Knows Bugs:

To run scleaner as root or sudo be sure to have /usr/local/lib in your libraries path or you will get the error message : 

./scleaner: error while loading shared libraries: libwx_gtk2_aui-2.8.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
